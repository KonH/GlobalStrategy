Drive a repo owner's feature-request issues through spec → plan → merge, entirely via comments and reactions on the issue itself. Invoked by `scripts/handle_feature_issues.py` (via `.sh`/`.ps1` wrappers), run on a cron schedule **in the user's own environment** (not this Claude Code Remote session) — see `.claude/rules/github_issue_automation.md` for the full design writeup.

The invocation prompt already contains the full candidate list — every open, `claude`-labeled, owner-authored issue with new activity, each as a `[ISSUE #N]` block with its URL, title, body, and a `reason` hint (`issue/comment updated` or `new reaction on a summary/conclusion comment`). **Do not re-scan the repo for other candidates** — that discovery already happened in the wrapper specifically so this process doesn't spend a turn (and subscription usage) rediscovering what it already knows. The reason hint only tells you an issue needs attention, not exactly what changed — investigate each one's full comment/reaction history yourself via `gh`.

**All conversation happens on the issue, never the PR.** PRs are just the code artifact — the spec+plan PR links back with `Part of #N` (it must not auto-close the issue), and the final implementation PR links with `Closes #N` (merging it is what ends the issue's lifecycle) — every summary, question, and conclusion this command posts is an issue comment, on both PRs alike.

Each invocation is a fresh `claude -p` process with no memory of previous runs; use `gh` CLI (already authenticated as the repo owner in that environment) and plain `git` for everything — this command must not assume any MCP tools are present.

Repo: `KonH/GlobalStrategy`. Owner to act on: `KonH`. Base branch: `main`.

## Comment marker and heading convention

Every comment this command posts starts with this exact first line:

```
<!-- claude-automation -->
```

(an HTML comment — invisible when rendered on GitHub). The **second line** is always one of these exact headings, so later runs can parse "what kind of comment is this" deterministically instead of re-interpreting free text:

- `## Spec Summary` — spec first drafted, may include clarifying questions
- `## Spec Conclusion` — spec finalized after Q&A, decisions recorded
- `## Plan Summary` — plan first drafted (via `/plan`), may include clarifying questions or constitution violations
- `## Plan Conclusion` — plan finalized after Q&A, decisions recorded
- `## Implementation Proposal` — implementation plan for the merged spec+plan posted, describing what the Ralph loop will build and how it'll be verified (see section 4's environment-marker rules); may include clarifying questions
- `## Implementation Summary` — a Ralph loop run finished (fully or partially) and its changes are pushed to the implementation PR; describes remaining/skipped steps and code-review points, waiting on your decision
- `## Clarification Needed` — a free-form follow-up question mid-review (spec, plan, or implementation phase)
- `## Needs Manual Attention` — the automation stopped and is waiting on you directly (see the round-cap and merge-conflict rules below)

The **phase** of an issue is derived by scanning its comments for the most recent of these headings: no `Spec Summary` yet → not started (shouldn't happen, since a PR/branch already existing implies one exists). Most recent is `Spec Summary`/`Spec Conclusion`/`Clarification Needed` under a spec context → **SPEC_REVIEW**. Most recent is `Plan Summary`/`Plan Conclusion`/`Clarification Needed` under a plan context → **PLAN_REVIEW**. Spec+plan PR merged, most recent is `Implementation Proposal`/`Implementation Summary`/`Clarification Needed` under an implementation context → **IMPLEMENT_REVIEW** (section 4). Implementation PR merged → done — that PR's `Closes #<issue-number>` is what finally auto-closes the issue, so it shouldn't still be labeled `claude`+open at that point.

## Progress checklist comment

A single comment tracks overall state at a glance, always **edited in place, never reposted** — it should end up as the issue's first comment, since it's created at the very start of a new request, before the Spec Summary. It starts with its own distinct marker on the first line (not the general one above, so it's never mistaken for a Summary/Conclusion/etc. comment during phase-detection or the "what's new" scan):

```
<!-- claude-automation:checklist -->
## Progress

- [ ] Spec drafted
- [ ] Spec approved
- [ ] Plan drafted
- [ ] Plan approved
- [ ] Merged
- [ ] Classified
- [ ] Implementation proposed
- [ ] Implementation approved
- [ ] Implemented
- [ ] Implementation merged

**Status:** <one-line current state, see below>
**Spec:** Docs/Specs/<YY_MM_DD_HH>_<slug>/ (once known)
**PR:** #<pr-number> (spec+plan PR, once known)
**Implementation PR:** #<pr-number> (once known)
```

Checkbox state is always fully derived from the current phase/merge/label state, never from whether a human clicked one — this is a read-only status display, not a second approval mechanism (approvals stay exactly the reaction-based flow in sections 3 and 4). Status line by phase: `SPEC_REVIEW` → "Awaiting your review of the spec — react 👍 on the Spec Summary/Conclusion comment to proceed to planning, or comment with feedback."; `PLAN_REVIEW` → same wording pointed at the plan; spec+plan merged, before the proposal posts → "Drafting the implementation proposal..."; `IMPLEMENT_REVIEW` with a proposal posted → "Awaiting your review of the implementation proposal — react 👍 on the Implementation Proposal comment to start implementing, or comment with feedback."; `IMPLEMENT_REVIEW` with a summary posted → "Awaiting your review of the implementation — see the Implementation Summary comment below. React 👍 to merge as-is, or comment with requested changes."; needs-attention → "⚠️ Needs manual attention — see the comment below."; implementation merged → "✅ Implementation merged into main. Issue closed."

To find the existing checklist comment: `gh api repos/KonH/GlobalStrategy/issues/<N>/comments`, look for the one whose body starts with `<!-- claude-automation:checklist -->`. If found, edit it in place:
```
jq -n --arg body "<updated content>" '{body:$body}' | \
gh api -X PATCH repos/KonH/GlobalStrategy/issues/comments/<comment-id> --input -
```
If not found (only happens on a brand-new issue), create it with `gh issue comment <N> --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --body "<content>"` **before** doing any other work, so it lands as comment #1.

Update this comment as the last step of handling any issue this cycle — every case below (2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d) ends with "update the progress checklist."

## Security

Every action below only ever triggers on content authored by `KonH` — the issue itself, its comments, its reactions. The wrapper already filters issues to `--author KonH`, but re-verify per comment/reaction too: ignore any comment or reaction from anyone else, even a collaborator. This is a hard rule, not a judgment call.

## Concurrency label (visibility only — the wrapper's own process lock is the real mutex)

At the very start of processing a given issue, apply the `claude-in-progress` label to it; remove it when you're done handling that issue in this run (whether you reached a conclusion, asked a question, or stopped for manual attention). This is purely so a human glancing at GitHub can see what's actively being worked — it is not what prevents double-processing (the wrapper's `flock` already guarantees only one `handle_feature_issues.py` runs at a time).

## Acknowledgment reactions

As soon as you identify what triggered processing for an issue, react to it immediately, before doing any real work:
- Triggered by a brand-new issue → add an `eyes` reaction to the issue itself.
- Triggered by a new comment → add an `eyes` reaction to that specific comment.
- Triggered by a new reaction (no new comment) → no ack reaction needed (you can't react to a reaction).

## Bounded clarification loop

Before posting another `Clarification Needed` comment in the current phase, count how many `Clarification Needed` comments already exist since the last `Spec Summary`/`Plan Summary` (whichever starts the current phase). If this would be the **4th**, don't ask again — instead post `## Needs Manual Attention` explaining the loop hasn't converged, apply the `claude-needs-attention` label, and stop. A later human comment on the issue is still picked up normally next run (new `updatedAt` → new candidate) and should be treated as a fresh attempt, implicitly resetting this — remove `claude-needs-attention` once you resume normal handling of it.

## 1. Classify each candidate

For issue `#N`, check whether a spec+plan PR already exists with head branch `claude/issue-<N>-*` (`gh pr list --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --state all --json number,headRefName,state`):

- **No such PR** → **new request** → go to step 2.
- **PR exists and is open** → fetch the issue's comments and reactions (see "Determining what's new" below) → go to step 3.
- **PR exists and merged** → the spec+plan phase is done. The issue is still open (its PR body says `Part of #N`, not `Closes #N` — see step 2.7) and now belongs to the implementation lifecycle. Fetch the issue's comments and reactions (see "Determining what's new" below) and go to section 4: a new comment → 4c, a new reaction → 4b. If neither the checklist nor the comments show an `Implementation Proposal` yet, go straight to 4a instead — that only happens if a prior run merged the spec+plan PR but was interrupted before posting the proposal.
- **PR exists and closed without merging** → done, skip (spec/plan was abandoned).

### Determining what's new (comment vs. reaction precedence)

Fetch `gh api repos/KonH/GlobalStrategy/issues/<N>/comments` and, for each comment starting with the marker, `gh api repos/KonH/GlobalStrategy/issues/comments/<comment-id>/reactions`. Compute:

- `last_owner_comment_at` = latest `created_at` among comments authored by `KonH` that do **not** start with the marker (i.e. real human comments, not the bot's own).
- `last_owner_reaction_at` = latest `created_at` among `KonH`-authored reactions on any marker comment.
- `last_bot_comment_at` = latest `created_at` among marker comments (the bot's own).

**A new comment always takes precedence over a reaction** — if `last_owner_comment_at > last_bot_comment_at`, treat this as a new comment to process (step 3), regardless of any reaction. Only if there's no newer comment but `last_owner_reaction_at > last_bot_comment_at`, treat it as a new reaction (step 3). If neither is newer than `last_bot_comment_at`, there's nothing new — skip (this happens when the `updatedAt`-based discovery hint was actually about the bot's own last comment, not new owner activity).

## 2. New request: write the spec and open a PR

1. Create the progress checklist comment first (see above) — all boxes unchecked, status "Drafting the spec...".
2. Feature name = the issue's title, as-is. Slugify it (lowercase, spaces/punctuation → `-`) for branch/folder naming.
3. Feature description = the issue's body; strip a leading `/specify` token if present.
4. `git fetch origin main`, then create and check out branch `claude/issue-<issue-number>-<slug>` from `origin/main`.
5. Invoke the `specify` command/skill (`.claude/commands/specify.md`) with the feature name + description. It writes `Docs/Specs/<YY_MM_DD_HH>_<slug>/spec.md` and normally "presents it to the user and stops" per `.claude/rules/workflow.md` — capture that presentation content for the `Spec Summary` comment below.
6. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push -u origin claude/issue-<issue-number>-<slug>`.
7. Open the PR: `gh pr create --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --title "<feature name>" --base main --head claude/issue-<issue-number>-<slug> --body "Part of #<issue-number>\n\n<brief summary>"`. Deliberately **not** `Closes` — this PR only carries the spec+plan; merging it must not auto-close the issue, since the implementation lifecycle (section 4) still needs it open. The eventual implementation PR is what carries `Closes #<issue-number>`.
8. Post on the **issue** (not the PR): marker line, then `## Spec Summary`, then the spec's presentation content and any clarifying questions, then a link to the PR.
9. Update the progress checklist: check "Spec drafted," fill in `**Spec:**` (the folder `/specify` just created) and `**PR:**`, status → the `SPEC_REVIEW` wording above.
10. Stop. Do **not** run `/plan` yet — that only happens after a 👍 on the Spec Summary/Conclusion comment (section 3b).

## 3. Existing PR: handle new activity

### 3a. New comment — clarification input

1. Determine the current phase (see the heading-scan rule above).
2. `git fetch origin <branch>` and check it out.
3. **SPEC_REVIEW**: read the comment as an answer to open spec questions. Edit `spec.md` directly to incorporate it (a normal file edit, not a from-scratch `/specify` re-run). `git add`/`commit`/`push`.
   - If this fully resolves the open questions → post `## Spec Conclusion` (decisions made, spec is ready for `/plan`). Update the checklist: still just "Spec drafted" checked, status → `SPEC_REVIEW` wording (a Conclusion still awaits the 👍 same as a Summary does).
   - If still unclear → post `## Clarification Needed` (subject to the bounded-loop rule above), or `## Needs Manual Attention` + `claude-needs-attention` if the round cap is hit — update the checklist status line accordingly either way.
4. **PLAN_REVIEW**: same pattern against `plan.md` (see section 3b for how the plan was produced) — edit directly, commit, push, then `## Plan Conclusion` or `## Clarification Needed`/`## Needs Manual Attention`, then update the checklist the same way (spec+plan boxes stay checked, status reflects the outcome).

### 3b. New reaction on a Spec Summary/Conclusion comment — proceed to plan

1. `git fetch origin <branch>` and check it out.
2. Invoke the `plan` command/skill (`.claude/commands/plan.md`) against the existing spec. It checks `Docs/Constitution.md`, writes `plan.md` into the same spec folder, and normally surfaces constitution violations + "stops and waits for user feedback" per `.claude/rules/workflow.md` — capture that content.
3. `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` to the same branch.
4. Post on the issue: marker line, `## Plan Summary`, the plan's presentation content (including any constitution violations flagged), and any clarifying questions.
5. Update the progress checklist: check "Spec approved" and "Plan drafted," status → `PLAN_REVIEW` wording.
6. Stop. Do **not** merge yet — that only happens after a 👍 on a Plan Summary/Conclusion comment.

### 3c. New reaction on a Plan Summary/Conclusion comment — merge

1. `git fetch origin main`, `git checkout <branch>`, `git merge origin/main`.
2. **Clean merge** → `git push`, then `gh pr merge <pr-number> --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --merge --delete-branch`. Then classify and label the issue (step 4 below).
3. **Conflict** → check `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`:
   - If the **only** conflicted file is `ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` and the **only** conflicting hunk in it is the `bundleVersion:` line: read both conflicting values, take the **greater** of the two, then apply the same increment `.claude/commands/commit.md` uses for a normal commit: `hundredths = X*100 + YY + 1`, reformat as `"{newMajor}.{newMinor:D2}"` where `newMajor = hundredths / 100` and `newMinor = hundredths % 100` — i.e. the resolved version is one higher than the larger of the two conflicting values, not either side as-is. Replace the conflict markers with that single resolved line, `git add`, `git commit` (completes the merge), `git push`, then merge the PR as in step 2 (including the classification below).
   - **Any other conflict** (any other file, or any other hunk even in `ProjectSettings.asset`) → `git merge --abort`. Post `## Needs Manual Attention` on the issue listing the conflicted file(s), apply `claude-needs-attention`, update the checklist status to the needs-attention wording, and stop. Never guess at resolving a real content conflict unattended.
4. **Classify and label the issue** (only after a successful merge, whether clean or conflict-resolved) — decide whether implementing this spec+plan is possible without a running Unity Editor:
   - `full-env-required` — the plan touches anything under `Assets/UI/`, `Assets/Prefabs/`, `.unity` scenes, `.prefab`/ScriptableObject assets, textures/flags/character portraits, or otherwise calls for Unity MCP tool usage (per `.claude/rules/unity/mcp_usage.md`) or the image-generation pipeline (`.claude/rules/image_generation.md`) to implement or verify.
   - `code-only` — the plan is confined to `src/` (Unity-independent domain logic), pure C# logic/ECS systems under `Assets/Scripts/` verifiable by `dotnet build`/tests without opening the Editor, or `scripts/*.py` config generators.
   - If genuinely mixed or unclear from the plan, default to `full-env-required` — wrongly labeling something `code-only` risks the implementation phase below (which never has a Unity Editor of its own — see section 4) planning work it can't actually attempt.
   - Apply with `gh issue edit <issue-number> --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --add-label <code-only|full-env-required>`.
5. Update the progress checklist: check "Plan approved" and "Merged," status → "Drafting the implementation proposal...". This PR intentionally does **not** close the issue (step 2.7) — the issue stays open through the implementation phase below.
6. **Continue immediately into implementation, in this same run**: go to section 4, step 4a (draft the Implementation Proposal). Do not wait for a new poll cycle — the merge and the proposal are one continuous action, the same way step 3b flows directly from a spec 👍 into drafting the plan.

## 4. Implementation lifecycle

Runs entirely after section 3c's merge, on the `ralph/<spec-id>` branch that `scripts/ralph.py` itself manages — never the now-deleted `claude/issue-<N>-<slug>` spec+plan branch. `<spec-id>` is the spec folder name (`Docs/Specs/<YY_MM_DD_HH>_<slug>/`), read back from the checklist's `**Spec:**` line rather than re-derived.

### 4a. Draft the Implementation Proposal (runs immediately after 3c's merge)

1. Summarize the merged `plan.md` into a short implementation proposal: what the Ralph loop will build, in what order, and how each piece will be gated (`dotnet build`/`dotnet test`, python config validation, or — `code-only` issues only — Unity MCP compile checks in a future interactive run). For a `full-env-required` issue, say explicitly that this automation has no Unity Editor available and list which plan steps will therefore be skipped entirely (Unity asset/scene/prefab/ScriptableObject work, image generation) versus which C# script steps will be attempted without compile verification — see `.claude/commands/create-prd.md`'s environment-marker rules for exactly how that split works.
2. Post on the issue: marker line, `## Implementation Proposal`, the summary from step 1, any clarifying questions.
3. Update the progress checklist: check "Implementation proposed," status → "Awaiting your review of the implementation proposal — react 👍 on the Implementation Proposal comment to start implementing, or comment with feedback."
4. Stop. Do **not** start the Ralph loop yet — that only happens after a 👍 on an Implementation Proposal/Summary comment (4b below).

### 4b. New reaction on an Implementation Proposal/Summary comment — run the Ralph loop

1. If `**Implementation PR:**` is not yet set on the checklist: `git fetch origin main`, `git checkout main`, `git reset --hard origin/main` — the Ralph branch starts fresh from `main`, which already has the merged spec+plan. If an implementation PR already exists from a previous round: `git fetch origin ralph/<spec-id>` and `git checkout ralph/<spec-id>` instead, so this round continues on top of prior implementation commits rather than restarting.
2. Map the issue's classification label to an environment marker for `--env`: `code-only` → `code-only`; `full-env-required` → `full-env-headless` (this automation never has Unity Editor/MCP, regardless of what the label says the plan needs).
3. Run:
   ```
   python scripts/ralph.py --spec <spec-id> --env <marker> --model claude-sonnet-5 --effort medium \
       --max-iterations 20 --auto-adjust-iterations --skip-pull-request --dangerously-skip-permissions
   ```
   `--auto-adjust-iterations` covers the "MaxIterations too low" failure mode by itself — `ralph.py` raises its own iteration budget to the PRD's recommended minimum instead of erroring out, so a single invocation is enough; no separate detect-and-re-run step is needed. `--skip-pull-request` is required — this section owns PR creation/update (it needs to be linked to the GitHub issue), not the generic `/complete-prd` → `/pr` flow, which has no knowledge of the issue number.
4. If the loop's final `=== Loop finished: <reason> ===` line reports `stalled_no_progress` or `claude_error`, or zero PRD tasks ended up `"passes": true` — treat this as blocked, not a normal (possibly partial) result: post `## Needs Manual Attention` quoting the relevant `.ralph/activity.md` entries, apply `claude-needs-attention`, update the checklist status accordingly, and stop. Do not open or update an implementation PR with no real progress behind it.
5. Otherwise (any real progress, even short of every task passing): run the review sub-agent step from `.claude/commands/code-review.md` against the branch's changes (`git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`) — spawn the review sub-agent and collect its concerns, but skip that command's interactive "ask the user to approve/skip each fix" flow entirely. Concerns are recorded for the Implementation Summary comment (step 7 below) and are only ever applied after the owner responds on the issue (4c), never auto-applied here.
6. Commit any remaining uncommitted changes via the **/commit** skill's rules (version bump included), then push: if `**Implementation PR:**` is not yet set on the checklist, `git push -u origin ralph/<spec-id>` and `gh pr create --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --title "<feature name> (implementation)" --base main --head ralph/<spec-id> --body "Closes #<issue-number>\n\n<brief summary>"` — this PR body uses `Closes`, unlike the spec+plan PR, since merging it is what finally closes the issue. If an Implementation PR already exists, just push to update it (no new PR).
7. Post on the issue: marker line, `## Implementation Summary`, covering: which PRD tasks passed/remain (from `.ralph/prd.md`), any plan steps skipped entirely because of the `full-env-headless` marker (from `/create-prd`'s report and `plan.md`'s `## Automation Notes` section), and the code-review concerns collected in step 5 (each with file/location, problem, proposed fix, same shape `code-review.md` already uses). Link the implementation PR.
8. Update the progress checklist: check "Implementation approved" (this round's 👍 is what triggered step 1) and "Implemented," fill in `**Implementation PR:**`, status → "Awaiting your review of the implementation — see the Implementation Summary comment below. React 👍 to merge as-is, or comment with requested changes."
9. Stop. Do **not** merge yet — that only happens after a 👍 on an Implementation Summary comment with no further requested changes (4d below).

### 4c. New comment on an Implementation Summary — apply requested changes

1. `git fetch origin ralph/<spec-id>` and check it out.
2. Read the comment as implementation feedback — code-review decisions (which flagged points to fix, which to skip) and/or new change requests. Apply directly (edit files); only re-run `scripts/ralph.py` the same way as 4b if the request is substantial enough to need its own multi-step loop, not for a small follow-up fix.
3. Commit via **/commit**, push to `ralph/<spec-id>` (updates the existing implementation PR automatically).
4. Post a short confirmation comment on the issue (marker + a plain sentence summarizing what changed, no special heading needed) and update the checklist status back to the "Awaiting your review..." wording from 4b.8 — subject to the same bounded-loop rule as spec/plan Q&A (a 4th unresolved round in this phase → `## Needs Manual Attention` instead of another silent fix-and-wait cycle).

### 4d. New reaction on an Implementation Summary comment (no further changes requested) — merge

1. `git fetch origin main`, `git checkout ralph/<spec-id>`, `git merge origin/main`. Resolve a `bundleVersion`-only conflict exactly as in 3c.3; abort and escalate to `## Needs Manual Attention` on anything else.
2. `git push`, then `gh pr merge <implementation-pr-number> --repo KonH/GlobalStrategy --merge --delete-branch`. The `Closes #<issue-number>` in this PR's body auto-closes the issue.
3. Update the progress checklist one last time: check "Implementation merged," status → "✅ Implementation merged into main. Issue closed."

## Non-goals

- Never touch issues or PRs authored by anyone other than `KonH`, or act on comments/reactions from anyone else.
- Never advance to `/plan` without an explicit 👍 on a Spec Summary/Conclusion comment.
- Never merge the spec+plan PR without an explicit 👍 on a Plan Summary/Conclusion comment.
- Never start the Ralph implementation loop without an explicit 👍 on an Implementation Proposal/Summary comment.
- Never merge the implementation PR without an explicit 👍 on an Implementation Summary comment with no unresolved change requests.
- Never apply code-review concerns to the implementation PR before the owner has responded to the Implementation Summary that lists them.
- Never auto-resolve a merge conflict that isn't exactly the single-line `bundleVersion` case described above.
- Never re-run the repo-wide `gh issue list` discovery the wrapper already did — operate only on the candidates given in the prompt.
- Never repost the progress checklist as a new comment once it exists — always edit the existing one in place.
